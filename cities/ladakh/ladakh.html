            The Land of High Passes, Ladakh, the newly created Union Territory in India (previously a part of Jammu & Kashmir), boasts a landscape that can leave you with your jaws dropped. It is a place where the landscape changes dramatically; it is truly astonishing to see the mountains, snow, cold desert, alpine meadows and lakes at a short distance from each other. Tourism in Ladakh is an absolute delight for nature lovers as well as adventurers. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Adorned with the lofty barren mountains, Ladakh is home to some of the highest motorable passes like Khardung La (5359 m), Marsimik La (5582 m), and Chang La (5360 m), and alpine lakes like Pangong Tso (4350 m) and Tso Moriri (4522 m). Ladakh is further divided into three regions - Leh, Nubra, and Zanskar, and each region has several places to see. Ladakh is majorly popular amongst the adventurers who feel welcomed by the number of adrenaline rushing activities offered here. The union territory is amongst the top trekking destinations in India with amazing and unmatched treks like the popular Frozen River Trek/Chadar Trek. Ladakh also has opportunities for mountaineering, motor biking, mountain biking, white water rafting and more.

            <strong> Zanskar Valley:</strong> Lies to the south –west of Ladakh, Zanskar often referred to as ‘Country of Dharma’. The region being associated with Guru Padmasambhava and the great  yogi Naropa has the Buddhist majority.  The region is a part of Kargil district and Zanskar is the only Buddhist majority sub-region, which has otherwise about 85% Muslim population. Zanskar valley is the most isolated of all the regions of Ladakh. Entire Zanskar is in fact a trekker’s paradise.

            <strong> Magnetic Hill: </strong>Located at a distance of about 30 kilometres from Leh on the Leh-Kargil Highway, Magnetic Hill is one of the interesting places to visit in Ladakh and is very well known for its magnetic properties. It is believed to have mysterious magnetic properties and this phenomenon is a sensation that attracts tourists from all over the world. The magnetism is apparently so strong that it has the power to pull a car uphill. Well, whether it is a visual illusion or actual magnetic force it is not certain but it is surely a fun thing to experience.

            <strong> The Statue of Liberty:</strong> Located in the capital town of Leh, the Leh Palace is the most excellent example of medieval Tibetan construction and architecture. Built in the seventh century by King Sengge Namgyal, it is made with mud, sand, stones and wood which provides warmth in the winter season and sets up a cool atmosphere in the summer season. Even though the palace is not classically decorated, there is something about the architecture of the palace which makes it appear majestic and grand. It is one of the best places to visit in Ladakh for people who like to explore the historical wonder. This nine storied structure provides a panoramic view of sunrise and sunset and the bustling town of Leh.

            <strong> Tso Moriri lake: </strong> A twin to the popular Pangong Tso Lake, Tso Moriri Lake is a lesser-known lake located in the Changtang Wildlife Sanctuary. Its location contributes to the scenic beauty of this lake. Barren hills with snow-capped mountains in the backdrop make the sight simply breathtaking.
