              The history of Egypt has been long and wealthy, due to the flow of the Nile River with its fertile banks and delta, as well as the accomplishments of Egypt's native inhabitants and outside influence. Much of Egypt's ancient history was a mystery until Egyptian hieroglyphs were deciphered with the discovery and help of the Rosetta Stone. Among the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World is the Great Pyramid of Giza.

            Cairo many achievements, preserved in its art and monuments, hold a fascination that continues to grow as archaeological finds expose its secrets. This article focuses on Egypt from its prehistory through its unification under Menes (Narmer) in the 3rd millennium BCE—sometimes used as a reference point for Egypt’s origin—and up to the Islamic conquest in the 7th century CE.Snefru was the first king of ancient Egypt of the 4th dynasty (c. 2575–c. 2465 BCE). He probably built the step pyramid of Maydūm and then modified it to form the first true pyramid.

            <strong> Admire Al-Azhar Mosque: </strong>Al-Azhar Mosque is the finest building of Cairo's Fatimid era and one of the city's earliest surviving mosques, completed in AD 972.
            It's also one of the world's oldest universities - Caliph El-Aziz bestowed it with the status of university in AD 988 (the other university vying for "oldest" status is in Fes) and today, Al-Azhar University is still the leading theological center of the Islamic world.

            <strong> Royal Mummies at NMEC:</strong> Unlike many of Cairo's other major museums, which all concentrate their exhibits on one specific era, the National Museum of Egyptian Civilizations (NMEC) is dedicated to telling the entire story of Egypt's human history under one roof.
            The museum partially opened in 2017 and has been slowly building up its exhibits. Its star attraction arrived in April 2020, when the Royal Mummies Collection found its new permanent home here.

            <strong> City at the Citadel: </strong> n a commanding location at the foot of the Mokattam Hills, Cairo's citadel was built by Saladin in 1176.
            The original structure he laid out has long disappeared except for the eastern outer walls, but a legacy of rulers has made their own additions here.
