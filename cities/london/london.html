            Noisy, vibrant and multicultural, London is one of the largest cities in the world with a population of 8 million people. It is a leading global city of culture, fashion, finance, politics and trade and remains one of the most visited city by international tourists in the world. The city contains many famous landmarks and getting around is easy. The famous London Underground, also known as the Tube, is one of the most extensive subway networks in the world. London can perhaps be called the most iconic city in the world. It is brimming with history and has been home to the Royal Family for a long time. Visitors here love its modern vibe but more than that, they are charmed by its old world charm that can only be felt when you do actually visit the city.
