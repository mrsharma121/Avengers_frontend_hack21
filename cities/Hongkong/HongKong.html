                Hong Kong, also known as officially <strong>the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China.</strong>  Hong Kong is a metropolitan area and special administrative region of China on the eastern Pearl River Delta in South China. Hong kong is a heritage and <strong>home to different religions from all around the world.</strong>  The mix of Buddhism, Confucianism, and Taoism makes up the core of Hong Kong religion, combined with myths, legends, and deities specific to each region. Hong Kong people have a crowded but surprisingly <strong>wealthy and healthy style of life.</strong>  Hong Kong culture is a mixture of traditional Han Cantonese ethnic culture of southeastern China and British and Western culture in general. Hong Kongers are being <strong>increasingly influenced by the culture of the Mainland Chinese.</strong>

            Keep an ear out for rhythmic Chinese drums announcing the arrival of a Chinese lion. Acrobatic lion dances are an essential element at Chinese New Year, for groundbreaking ceremonies and business openings.With over 8,000 glittering skyscrapers, Hong Kong’s skyline is always one to marvel at. Its tallest building, almost half a kilometre high, sits in West Kowloon and is the International Commerce Centre or ICC. Crowning the building is The Ritz-Carlton Hong Kong whose bar and swimming pool are located on the building’s 118th floor, making them the highest in the world.You are considered lucky if you have a daughter followed by a son in Hong Kong. Their characters together in Chinese symbols mean “good”.

            <strong> Hong Kong Skyline:</strong> Hong Kong has one of the most impressive and recognizable skylines in the world. The dense collection of skyscrapers, both on the island of Hong Kong and in Kowloon, combined with the surrounding mountains and harbor set this city apart.In the harbor, traditional red-sailed Chinese junk boats and the historic Star Ferry contrast sharply with the backdrop of modern high-rises. At night, the skyline changes character completely as the sky darkens and the city lights fill the scene.

            <strong> Victoria Peak (The Peak): </strong>You haven't seen the best of Hong Kong until you've taken in the skyline from Victoria Peak, more commonly known as The Peak. Ride the tram to the top of this scenic viewpoint to see the skyscrapers, bustling city, harbor, and surrounding islands.

            <strong> Big Buddha (Tian Tan Buddha Statue):</strong> The 34-meter-high "Big Buddha" sits above Lantau Island's Po Lin monastery, which was a fairly secluded place until the statue was built in 1993. This is one of the largest Buddha statues of its kind in the world and took 12 years to complete. The size is astounding, both up close and seen from a distance. The setting here is also incredible, surrounded by the green forest and views out over the ocean and islands.
